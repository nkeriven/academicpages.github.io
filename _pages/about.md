I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Ecole Normale Supérieure, on the [CFM-ENS](https://data-ens.github.io) "Laplace" chair in data science.

I organize the [Laplace reading group](https://data-ens.github.io/reading_group/), send me a mail if you want to subscribe to the mailing list or give a presentation.

We organize the [Sparsity4PSL](https://sparsity4psl.github.io) summer school in June 2019.

Short Bio

I graduated from Ecole polytechnique (Palaiseau, France), and obtained the « Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage » (MVA) Master’s degree from Ecole Normale Supérieure de Cachan in 2014. I prepared my thesis at IRISA, Rennes, France, under the supervision of Rémi Gribonval, and defended it in October, 2017. I received the Best Student Paper Award at SPARS 2017 in Lisbon.
