I organize the [Laplace reading group](https://data-ens.github.io/reading_group/), send me a mail if you want to subscribe to the mailing list or present something.

I graduated from Ecole polytechnique (Palaiseau, France), and obtained the « Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage » (MVA) Master’s degree from Ecole Normale Supérieure de Cachan in 2014. I prepared my thesis at IRISA, Rennes, France, under the supervision of Rémi Gribonval, and defended it in October, 2017. I received the Best Student Paper Award at SPARS 2017 in Lisbon.
